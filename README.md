# Chelsea FC Performance Analysis (2021–2024)

## Project Overview
This project analyses Chelsea FC’s match-level performance across three Premier League seasons using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The aim is to identify performance trends, evaluate key metrics, and demonstrate practical data analysis and visualisation skills.

## Objectives
- Analyse team performance across multiple seasons  
- Identify trends in attacking and defensive metrics  
- Visualise key performance indicators clearly  
- Apply statistical and predictive analysis techniques  

## Dataset
The dataset consists of match-level statistics collected across three seasons.  
Player-level data is excluded, focusing only on team performance metrics such as goals, possession, shots, and defensive actions.

> Note: The full dataset is not included in this repository. Instructions or sample data can be provided if required.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- scikit-learn
